This project uses Logistic Regression to predict survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic. It is part of a capstone project completed under the AICTE Edunet Internship Program.

📌 Problem Statement

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using features like class, gender, age, fare, etc.
	•	Type: Binary Classification
	•	Goal: Understand key factors affecting survival
	•	Real-World Use: Shows how ML can be used for decision-making in life-critical scenarios
